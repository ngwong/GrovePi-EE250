## **EE 250L Spring 2018 Lab 04 Part 2**

In part 2, we will switch over to the UDP protocol and communicate between your
VM and your Raspberry Pi over the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) using
sockets. The example code we will run here will illustrate how ports are used to
demultiplex packets to the different processes that run on a machine which has
a single IP address.

By now, you should've already cloned this repo into your VM. Login to your rpi
and clone this repository under a directory with a lab partner's name (remember,
this step is importatn because the rpis may be used by someone else!).
