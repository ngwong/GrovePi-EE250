# **EE 250L Spring 2018 Lab 04 Part 3**

In part 3, we will send sensor data from your rpi to your VM, and turn on and 
off a GrovePi LED connected to your rpi from your VM. In part 1 and 2, we 
covered enough material to give you the tools to accomplish this last task on
your own. 

## **Step 1**

`cd` into the GrovePi-EE250/Script/ folder and run

    sudo bash install.sh

Then, `cd` to GrovePi-EE250/Software/Python/ and play with the 
`grove_ultrasonic.py` and `grove_led_blink.py` scripts to figure out how to 
interact with the GrovePi sensors.
